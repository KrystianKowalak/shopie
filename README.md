This is the Home Page view. From here, we can navigate to all products. The marquee displays the products in a fluid motion where visitors can see the products available. There are two options to sort through the categories of the products. The category bubbles will allow for easy access to one category of products. The category checkboxes allow for the viewers to click multiple products they would like to see. The home page shows where one can sign in or log in.
